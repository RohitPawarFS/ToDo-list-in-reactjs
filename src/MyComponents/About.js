            <b>What is a To-do list?</b><br />
            To-do lists are simple, yet effective tools that can break down bigger tasks into smaller, concrete steps. They can range from individual daily tasks, to larger group goals. You can make a to-do list for any project, anytime your team needs to get something done. Breaking down tasks into concrete steps helps your team reach your goals with ease.<br />

            What are the benefits of to-do lists? They are a great way to organize tasks, from the mundane to the more difficult. They also keep your team focused, and progressing toward your goals.<br />
            
            Writing to-do lists is a helpful way to keep yourself on track with everything you have to do that day, week, or month. From tasks at work to picking up groceries on the way home â€“ lists provide a simple structure and help you to arrange the environment around you.<br />





            To-Do lists have reportedly been around since the early twentieth century, when they were introduced as a way to improve productivity. The vast majority of people would probably admit to using them at least from time to time as a way of managing their workload and flow.<br />
            <b>To-Do lists work for one main reason:</b><br />
            
            We tend to worry about things that we have left uncompleted<br />
            Our brains like things to be finished off and tidy, which means that we worry about things that need doing. That ought to mean that making a list of things to do makes us more worried, but it turns out that it actually tricks the brain into thinking that the task has been done.<br />

            In other words, writing things down on a to-do list means that you stop worrying, and actually have time to prioritise and then complete your tasks.<br />
            Make your list work for you<br />
            Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that your list should work for you, not the other way round.<br /> <br /> 

           <b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
               It is a tool, for your work.</b>
